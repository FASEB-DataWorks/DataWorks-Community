Data sharing and re-use is increasingly understood as necessary to support rigor and reproducibility in scientific research. However, even within research groups, how data are collected, stored, and shared is often left to individual researchers who themselves are not trained in data sharing standards and techniques. The DataWorks! Capacity Program develops expertise in data sharing and re-use for biological and biomedical researchers and teams through focused training and service experiences. An embedded ambassador alumni program with ongoing professional development and networking fosters community engagement, practice adoption, and new career options. Nominations and application review criteria reflect and support FASEB’s diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion goals.  

## Research teams 
(available starting January 2022)
**Goal:  Develop team-science skills in cohorts of mentored groups.**
