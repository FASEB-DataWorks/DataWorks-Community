# DataWorks! Community

![DW Community Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90872869/145875407-f207624e-1412-4c27-bc82-9f091510e73b.jpg "FASEB DataWorks! Community icon")

DataWorks! Community enables biological and biomedical researchers and teams to hone skills and mentor peers in data management and sharing.

Data sharing and reuse is increasingly understood as necessary to support rigor and reproducibility in scientific research. However, even within research groups, how data are collected, stored, and shared is often left to individual researchers who themselves are not trained in data sharing standards and techniques. The DataWorks! Capacity Program develops expertise in data sharing and reuse for biological and biomedical researchers and teams through focused training and service experiences. An embedded ambassador alumni program with ongoing professional development and networking fosters community engagement, practice adoption, and new career options. Nominations and application review criteria reflect and support FASEB’s diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion goals. 

## Research teams 

**Goal:  Develop team-science skills in cohorts of mentored groups.**
An online course for research groups to explore and implement social and technical infrastructure for team work, including team charters, open project plans, document sharing facilities, and basic coding skills.  Provided in collaboration with [Openscapes](https://openscapes.org)

Nominations are now open for the DataWorks! OpenScapes Champions program!  This professional development opportunity for research groups in the biological and biomedical sciences to develop leadership in open research data practices.  The program will be carried out remotely through a series of videoconferences, asynchronous assignments, and online mentoring.  Sponsored by FASEB DataWorks!, there is no fee to participate.

## Individual researchers 
(launching in 2022)

**Goal:  Develop Subject Matter Experts and Ambassadors**
An embedded experience for researchers at any career stage that includes targeted curricula, hands-on service learning through the FASEB Data Help Desk, communication training through FASEB Data Salons and Knowledgebase content development, and policy experience through FASEB’s public affairs group.

*Eligibility:*  Doctorate-level researchers at any career stage working in a discipline represented by a FASEB member society.  Participants will be provided a stipend and a completion certificate.

*Time Commitment:*  80% over 10 months.  Aspects of this program can be carried out remotely.

*Capacity:* 1 group of 10 people, once a year.  Stipend provided. 

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding for the Capacity Program and the Catalyst Prize.
