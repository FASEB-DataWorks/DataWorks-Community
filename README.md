DataWorks! Community enables biological and biomedical researchers and teams to hone skills and mentor peers in data management and sharing.  *Planned launch in 2022.*

Data sharing and reuse is increasingly understood as necessary to support rigor and reproducibility in scientific research. However, even within research groups, how data are collected, stored, and shared is often left to individual researchers who themselves are not trained in data sharing standards and techniques. The DataWorks! Community program develops expertise in data sharing and reuse for biological and biomedical researchers and teams through focused training and service experiences. An embedded ambassador alumni program with ongoing professional development and networking fosters community engagement, practice adoption, and new career options. Nominations and application review criteria reflect and support FASEBâ€™s diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion goals. 

FASEB is developing an embedded experience for researchers at any career stage.  The program includes targeted curricula, hands-on service learning through the FASEB DataWorks! Help Desk and communication training through FASEB DataWorks! Salons. We are pleased to partner with Carpentries, CyVerse, RDAP, and the Digital Curation Network!

*Eligibility:*  Doctorate-level researchers at any career stage working in a discipline represented by a FASEB member society.  Participants will be provided a stipend and a completion certificate.

*Time Commitment:*  80% over 3 months.  Most aspects of this program will be carried out remotely.

*Capacity:* 2-3 groups of 6-10 people each year.  

# Join the Conversation!

FASEB is a recent entry into the data sharing and reuse ecosystem, and as such  we seek to learn and partner with organizations and initiatives already in this space.  FASEB DataWorks! activities can build bridges, augment and amplify resources for adoption and use by researchers in the biological and biomedical communities -- and beyond.  We are currently seeking partners for curriculum development, ongoing professional development opportunities, and funding to support the Community and Prize programs.
